# Student_performance

This mini project downloads, cleans, and fits a model to the UCI dataset located [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

The dataset contains a collection of several demographic, social and school re-lated attributes (e.g. student’s age, alcohol consump- tion, mother’s education). And the aim is to predict student achievement and if possible to identify the key variables that affect educational success/failure.
